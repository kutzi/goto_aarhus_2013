Architecural Simplicity through events
======================================
Russ Miles

* Challenge: build the 'right thing' the 'right way'!

Axioms
------
* 1st role of software is to be useful
* Human comprehension is king
* [Mechanical sympathy](http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.de/) is queen
* Software is Research (!) and Development. The former is often being forgotten!

Simplicity
----------
* Simple software is sw which can change/adapt to changing requirements
** This does specifically *not* mean sw which is so configurable to be adaptable to 'all possible' requirements during runtime!
* Why do we don't write simple sw?
** constant change in requirements
** Bored by business problems?
