Brian Chess: Security in the 21th Century
=========================================

Keynote Monday Morning

* 'Success is foreseeing [possible] failures'
* Static analysis tools are tools
** Chainsaw metaphor: you can clearly see that it will not cut the trees for you by itself!
** help you to find possible failures
** do NOT make your Software more secure by themselves
** you need educated developers to understand the output of the tools and act accordingly
* Get help from experts when trying to build secure software!
* minimize (security) decisions (for your developers): make the secure way the simple way [in your APIs]!
